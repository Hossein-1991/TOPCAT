# TOPCAT
Introduction:
-------------
TOPCAT is an useful software for data surveys as well as visualizing them. It has access to many public data sets and is at researcher's convenience. There are many worthwhile data about celestial objects which can be downloaded easily. 

You can download the program here: http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/

My Goal:
-----------
During my research, I had to work with this software for a while. Due to lack of enough educative papers, I decided to share my information. Although this is not an advanced paper, it will help those who are new. 

Query Language:
------------------
This software's basic language is Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL). You can find the basic introduction to this language here: https://www.gaia.ac.uk/data/gaia-data-release-1/adql-cookbook.
